    - title: Is this course for me?
      description: |
        This course offers an overview of the Cosmos SDK, as well as examples and exercises to help developers get a quick start.
    - title: How should I go through this course?
      description: |
        This course unfolds the Cosmos universe, beginning with a big picture perspective and getting into how to create your own application-specific blockchain with the Cosmos SDK.<br/>
        You can follow two tracks: The fast track and the deep dive. The fast track gives you a solid overview of the Cosmos SDK, its components, and dApps in Cosmos. The deep dive takes you through hands-on exercises to put theory into practice – showcasing how to address application concerns when developing such as managing gas fees and cross-chain communication, working with Ignite CLI, running a node, and understanding CosmWasm. All sections are tagged accordingly as “Fast track” or “Deep dive”. A look into all chapters is recommended as a basic understanding helps when things get tricky.
    - title: What do I need?
      description: |
        For the fast track, you should have a solid understanding of blockchain technology and be familiar with decentralized applications. The deep dives are specially designed for experienced developers.
    - title: How long does it take me?
      description: |
        With the fast-track, you will gain a solid understanding of Cosmos and its SDK. This might be a matter of just an hour or two. The time you spend on the deep dive depends on you – there are endless possibilities to discover. <br/><br/>
        Welcome to the cosmos!
