    - title: Is this course for me?
      description: |
        This course offers an overview of the Cosmos SDK, as well as examples and exercises to help developers get a quick start.
    - title: How should I go through this course?
      description: |
        This course unfolds the Cosmos universe, beginning with a big picture perspective and getting into how to create your own application-specific blockchain with the Cosmos SDK.<br/>
        You can follow two tracks: The fast track and the deep dive. The fast track gives you a solid overview of the Cosmos SDK, its components, and dApps in Cosmos. The deep dive takes you through hands-on exercises to put theory into practice – showcasing how to address application concerns when developing such as managing gas fees and cross-chain communication, working with Ignite CLI, running a node, and understanding CosmWasm. All sections are tagged accordingly as “Fast track” or “Deep dive”. A look into all chapters is recommended as a basic understanding helps when things get tricky.
    - title: What do I need?
      description: |
        For the fast track, you should have a solid understanding of blockchain technology and be familiar with decentralized applications. The deep dives are specially designed for experienced developers.
    - title: How long does it take me?
      description: |
        With the fast-track, you will gain a solid understanding of Cosmos and its SDK. This might be a matter of just an hour or two. The time you spend on the deep dive depends on you – there are endless possibilities to discover. <br/><br/>
        Welcome to the cosmos!

This repo contains the code and content for the published [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/).

Note: The layout metadata at the top of the README.md file controls how the tutorial page is published. Write permissions are limited to preserve the structure and contents.

These tutorials guide you through actionable steps and walk-throughs to teach you how to use Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK is the world’s most popular framework for building application-specific blockchains. Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions to help you build foundational knowledge and learn how to use Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK, including:

* Foundational knowledge to help you navigate between blockchains with the Cosmos SDK
* Learn how Ignite CLI works
* Create a blockchain polling application
* Build an exchange that works with two or more blockchains
* Interact with the Cosmos Hub Testnet to test the functionality of your blockchain
* Use the liquidity module, known on the Cosmos Hub as Gravity DEX, to create liquidity pools so users can swap tokens
* Publish your blockchain application to a Droplet on DigitalOcean
* Connect to a testnet
* Design, build, and run an app as a scavenger hunt game

The code and docs for each tutorial are based on a specific version of the software. Be sure to follow the tutorial instructions to download and use the right version.

Use the tutorials landing page as your entry point to articles on [Cosmos blog](https://blog.cosmos.network/), videos on [Cosmos YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject/videos), and ways to get help and support.

This repo manages and publishes the tutorials. For details, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [TECHNICAL-SETUP](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md).
The tutorials are formatted using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md).
