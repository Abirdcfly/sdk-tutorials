# Adding Packet and Acknowledgement data

It's time to learn how to define packets and acks (acknowledgements) for the Leaderboard blockchain. Remember that this blockchain will mostly be receiving packets from the checkers blockchain or other gaming chains. This will be handled in the checkers blockchain extension tutorial.

In this section you will add an additional packet definition that will enable the Leaderboard chain to send a packet to connected game chains when a player has entered the top of the rankings.

The documentation on how to define packets and acks in IBC can be found in [the IBC go docs](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/apps/packets_acks.html).

## Scaffold a packet with Ignite CLI

Scaffold the IBC packet data with Ignite CLI and compare once more with _git diff_:

```bash
ignite scaffold packet ibcTopRank playerId rank score --ack playerId --module leaderboard
```

Note that the packet is called `ibcTopRank`, which includes the fields `playerId`, `rank`, and `score`. Additionally, you will send back the `playerId` of a player who enters the top of the rankings through the `Acknowledgement`.

The output on the terminal gives an overview of the changes made:

```bash
modify proto/leaderboard/packet.proto
modify proto/leaderboard/tx.proto
modify x/leaderboard/client/cli/tx.go
create x/leaderboard/client/cli/tx_ibc_top_rank.go
modify x/leaderboard/handler.go
create x/leaderboard/keeper/ibc_top_rank.go
create x/leaderboard/keeper/msg_server_ibc_top_rank.go
modify x/leaderboard/module_ibc.go
modify x/leaderboard/types/codec.go
modify x/leaderboard/types/events_ibc.go
create x/leaderboard/types/messages_ibc_top_rank.go
create x/leaderboard/types/messages_ibc_top_rank_test.go
create x/leaderboard/types/packet_ibc_top_rank.go

ðŸŽ‰ Created a packet `ibcTopRank`.
```
Next you will investigate each of the most important additions to the code.

## Proto definitions

The first additions are to the proto definitions in the `packet.proto` and `tx.proto` files:

```diff
@@ message LeaderboardPacketData {
    oneof packet {
        NoData noData = 1;
        // this line is used by starport scaffolding # ibc/packet/proto/field
+		IbcTopRankPacketData ibcTopRankPacket = 2; 
        // this line is used by starport scaffolding # ibc/packet/proto/field/number
    }
}
```

With `IbcTopRankPacketData`:

```protobuf
// IbcTopRankPacketData defines a struct for the packet payload
message IbcTopRankPacketData {
  string playerId = 1;
  string rank = 2;
  string score = 3;
}
```

And the ack:

```protobuf
// IbcTopRankPacketAck defines a struct for the packet acknowledgment
message IbcTopRankPacketAck {
	  string playerId = 1;
}
```

In `tx.proto` a Message service is added:

```diff
// Msg defines the Msg service.
service Msg {
+   rpc SendIbcTopRank(MsgSendIbcTopRank) returns (MsgSendIbcTopRankResponse);
    // this line is used by starport scaffolding # proto/tx/rpc
}
```

Where: 

```protobuf
message MsgSendIbcTopRank {
  string creator = 1;
  string port = 2;
  string channelID = 3;
  uint64 timeoutTimestamp = 4;
  string playerId = 5;
  string rank = 6;
  string score = 7;
}

message MsgSendIbcTopRankResponse {
}
```

<HighlightBox type="note">

The proto definitions will be compiled into `types/packet.pb.go` and `types/tx.pb.go`.

</HighlightBox>

## CLI commands

Ignite CLI also creates CLI commands to send packets, and adds them to the `client/cli/` folder.

You can thus send packets from the CLI with the following command:

```bash
leaderboardd tx leaderboard send-ibcTopRank [portID] [channelID] [playerId] [rank] [score]
```

## SendPacket and Packet callback logic

When scaffolding an IBC module with Ignite CLI you saw the implementation of the `IBCModule` interface, including a barebones packet callbacks structure. Now that you have also scaffolded a packet (and ack), the callbacks have been added with logic to handle the _receive_, _ack_, and _timeout_ scenarios. 

Additionally, for the sending of a packet a message server has been added that handles a SendPacket message, in this case `MsgSendIbcTopRank`.

<Highlightbox type="tip">

IBC allows developers some freedom regarding how to implement the custom logic, decoding and encoding packets, and processing acks. The provided structure is just one example of how to do this.

It makes sense to focus on the general flow to handle user messages or IBC callbacks, rather than the specific implementation by Ignite CLI.

</Highlightbox>

### Sending packets

To handle a user submitting a message to send an IBC packet, a message server is added to the handler:

```diff
    @@ x/leaderboard/handler.go
    func NewHandler(k keeper.Keeper) sdk.Handler {
+        msgServer := keeper.NewMsgServerImpl(k)

        return func(ctx sdk.Context, msg sdk.Msg) (*sdk.Result, error) {
            ctx = ctx.WithEventManager(sdk.NewEventManager())

            switch msg := msg.(type) {
+            case *types.MsgSendIbcTopRank:
+               res, err := msgServer.SendIbcTopRank(sdk.WrapSDKContext(ctx), msg)
+               return sdk.WrapServiceResult(ctx, res, err)
                // this line is used by starport scaffolding # 1
            default:
                errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("unrecognized %s message type: %T", types.ModuleName, msg)
                return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrUnknownRequest, errMsg)
            }
        }
    }
```

It calls the `SendIbcTopRank` method on the message server, defined as:

```go
func (k msgServer) SendIbcTopRank(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgSendIbcTopRank) (*types.MsgSendIbcTopRankResponse, error) {
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

	// TODO: logic before transmitting the packet

	// Construct the packet
	var packet types.IbcTopRankPacketData

	packet.PlayerId = msg.PlayerId
	packet.Rank = msg.Rank
	packet.Score = msg.Score

	// Transmit the packet
	err := k.TransmitIbcTopRankPacket(
		ctx,
		packet,
		msg.Port,
		msg.ChannelID,
		clienttypes.ZeroHeight(),
		msg.TimeoutTimestamp,
	)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &types.MsgSendIbcTopRankResponse{}, nil
}
```

This in turn calls the `TransmitIbcTopRankPacket` method on the module's keeper, defined in `x/leaderboard/keeper/ibc_top_rank.go`. This method gets all of the required metadata from core IBC before sending the packet using the ChannelKeeper's `SendPacket` function:

```go
func (k Keeper) TransmitIbcTopRankPacket(
	ctx sdk.Context,
	packetData types.IbcTopRankPacketData,
	sourcePort,
	sourceChannel string,
	timeoutHeight clienttypes.Height,
	timeoutTimestamp uint64,
) error {

	sourceChannelEnd, found := k.ChannelKeeper.GetChannel(ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel)
	... // error validation

	destinationPort := sourceChannelEnd.GetCounterparty().GetPortID()
	destinationChannel := sourceChannelEnd.GetCounterparty().GetChannelID()

	// get the next sequence
	sequence, found := k.ChannelKeeper.GetNextSequenceSend(ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel)
	... // error validation

	channelCap, ok := k.ScopedKeeper.GetCapability(ctx, host.ChannelCapabilityPath(sourcePort, sourceChannel))
	... // error validation

	packetBytes, err := packetData.GetBytes()
	... // error validation

	packet := channeltypes.NewPacket(
		packetBytes,
		sequence,
		sourcePort,
		sourceChannel,
		destinationPort,
		destinationChannel,
		timeoutHeight,
		timeoutTimestamp,
	)

	if err := k.ChannelKeeper.SendPacket(ctx, channelCap, packet); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
```

<HighlightBox type="note">

When you want to add additional custom logic before transmitting the packet, you do so in the `SendIbcTopRank` method on the message server.

</HighlightBox>

### Receiving packets

In a previous section we examined the `OnRecvPacket` callback in the `x/leaderboard/module_ibc.go` file. 

There, Ignite CLI had set up a structure to dispatch the packet depending on packet type through a switch statement. Now, by adding the `IbcTopRank` packet, a case has been added:

```go
// @ switch packet := modulePacketData.Packet.(type) in OnRecvPacket
case *types.LeaderboardPacketData_IbcTopRankPacket:
		packetAck, err := am.keeper.OnRecvIbcTopRankPacket(ctx, modulePacket, *packet.IbcTopRankPacket)
		if err != nil {
			ack = channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err.Error())
		} else {
			// Encode packet acknowledgment
			packetAckBytes, err := types.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&packetAck)
			if err != nil {
				return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrJSONMarshal, err.Error()).Error())
			}
			ack = channeltypes.NewResultAcknowledgement(sdk.MustSortJSON(packetAckBytes))
		}
		ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
			sdk.NewEvent(
				types.EventTypeIbcTopRankPacket,
				sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, types.ModuleName),
				sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyAckSuccess, fmt.Sprintf("%t", err != nil)),
			),
		)
```

The first line of code in the case statement calls the application's `OnRecvIbcTopRankPacket` callback on the keeper to process the reception of the packet. 

```go
// OnRecvIbcTopRankPacket processes packet reception
func (k Keeper) OnRecvIbcTopRankPacket(ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, data types.IbcTopRankPacketData) (packetAck types.IbcTopRankPacketAck, err error) {
	// validate packet data upon receiving
	if err := data.ValidateBasic(); err != nil {
		return packetAck, err
	}

	// TODO: packet reception logic

	return packetAck, nil
}
```
<Highlightbox type="note">

Remember that the `OnRecvPacket` callback writes an acknowledgement as well (to cover the synchronous write ack case).

</Highlightbox>

### Acknowledging packets

Similarly to the `OnRecvPacket` case, Ignite CLI already prepared the structure of the `OnAcknowledgementPacket` with the switch statement. Again, scaffolding the packet adds a case to the switch:

```go
// @ switch packet := modulePacketData.Packet.(type) in OnAcknowledgmentPacket
	case *types.LeaderboardPacketData_IbcTopRankPacket:
		err := am.keeper.OnAcknowledgementIbcTopRankPacket(ctx, modulePacket, *packet.IbcTopRankPacket, ack)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		eventType = types.EventTypeIbcTopRankPacket
```

This calls into the newly created application keeper's ack packet callback:

```go
func (k Keeper) OnAcknowledgementIbcTopRankPacket(ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, data types.IbcTopRankPacketData, ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) error {
	switch dispatchedAck := ack.Response.(type) {
	case *channeltypes.Acknowledgement_Error:

		// TODO: failed acknowledgement logic
		_ = dispatchedAck.Error

		return nil
	case *channeltypes.Acknowledgement_Result:
		// Decode the packet acknowledgment
		var packetAck types.IbcTopRankPacketAck

		if err := types.ModuleCdc.UnmarshalJSON(dispatchedAck.Result, &packetAck); err != nil {
			// The counter-party module doesn't implement the correct acknowledgment format
			return errors.New("cannot unmarshal acknowledgment")
		}

		// TODO: successful acknowledgement logic

		return nil
	default:
		// The counter-party module doesn't implement the correct acknowledgment format
		return errors.New("invalid acknowledgment format")
	}
}
```
This allows you to add custom application logic for both failed and successful acks.

### Timing out packets

Timing out packets follows the same flow, adding a case to the switch statement in `OnTimeoutPacket`, calling into the keeper's timeout packet callback where the custom logic can be implemented.

The reader is invited to check this out independently.

### Extra bits

Next to the above, some other additions have been made to the `types` package. These include `codec.go`, `events_ibc.go`, and `messages_ibc_top_rank.go`.

Again, the reader should check these out independently.

## Summary

To summarize what has been accomplished so far:
- You have scaffolded a chain with an IBC enabled module, both chain and module called leaderboard.
- Ignite CLI made sure to implement the `IBCModule` interface, including channel handshake and packet callbacks.
- Ignite CLI bound our IBC module to a port and added a route to the IBC router.
- You have scaffolded an IBC packet, `IbcTopRankPacket`.
- Ignite CLI defined the packet and ack data.
- Ignite CLI set up the basic message handling and packet handling to send, receive, acknowledge, and timeout packets.

<HighlightBox type="note">

Even though right now you have enabled the ability to send and receive packets, you have yet to implement application logic that will execute when this occurs. This is outside the scope of this section. The reader is invited to follow the checkers blockchain extension tutorial [insert link](xxxxxxxxx).

</HighlightBox>

<Highlightbox type="info">

When scaffolding a packet, Ignite CLI will by default ensure the chain can act both as the sender and receiver of a packet. This is a symmetrical setup which makes sense for some applications, like ICS20.

However, it's also possible to have an asymmetrical setup, where one chain will always be either the source or destination chain for a given packet, but not both. In this case, you can update the message server and packet callbacks to error, for example when a chain receives a packet though it is supposed to be exclusively the destination chain.

Interchain Accounts, or ICS27, is an example of this asymmetrical situation, as is the checkers extension tutorial.
