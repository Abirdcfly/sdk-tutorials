<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Blockchain Basics</h1>

As well as [introducing blockchain](LINK TO MOD1) and [Cosmos](LINK TO MOD2), the previous chapter discussed some useful generalities: [systems of decentralization](LINK TO MOD3), the [central problems that blockchain either solves or mitigates](LINK TO MOD4), some [examples of real-world use cases](LINK TO MOD5), and an [overview of working in Web3](LINK TO MOD6).

Chapter 2 will build on this knowledge by exploring the mechanics of blockchain in an accessible way. At the end of this chapter, you will understand how this technology works  â€“ an everyday level of comprehension that doesn't get into the complexities of coding.

<HighlightBox type="learning">

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* Ledgers, Blocks, and Hashing
* Proof of Work
* Updating the Blockchain
* Privacy and Confidentiality
* Engaging with the Cosmos Ecosystem


At the end of the chapter you will find a [Resource Bank](./6-resource-bank.md) which provides a concise run-down of exactly how Cosmos implements the various features of blockchain that have been discussed, and how it can be differentiated from other Web3 service providers. There is also another [self-assessment quiz](./7-self-assessment.md) so you can check your understanding of the chapter and identify subjects for discussion during your weekly support call with a blockchain expert.
