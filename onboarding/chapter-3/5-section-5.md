Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, the cryptocurrency space has grown at a very rapid pace. Less than fifteen years later, the estimated number of existing cryptocurrencies lies between 10,000 and 20,000, each with its unique quirks and value propositions. The magnitude with which this crypto-economy has evolved makes it almost impossible to keep up. In addition, with a large number of tokens worth millions of US-Dollars being traded daily, it is inevitable that many people question the security and incentives of each of these tokens.

## Crypto economics

**Crypto Economics** is the coming together of *cryptography* and *economics*: 

* **Cryptography** provides the means to authenticate messages, create the immutable chain, secure addresses, etc.
* **Economic insights** are used to create structures within distributed systems that make node behavior more predictable.

One could say, cryptography ensures backward-facing security through practical systems, and economics ensures forward-facing security through incentive systems.

The way an economy acts is strongly linked to existing *and possible* fiscal and monetary policy:

* **Monetary policy:** all political decisions and regulations targeted at governing money supply, i.e. creating a well-equilibrated supply and demand of money.
* **Fiscal policy:** decisions and regulations in the area of financial governance, i.e. creating a system of well-equilibrated revenues (taxes) and expenditures (spending).

The appearance of cryptocurrencies may yet have an immense disruptive impact on the fiscal and monetary policies of governments. Before the introduction of blockchain technology, there was already precedent for how any change to the accepted conventions could be viewed as threatening before ultimately being embraced. The proposal of **the Euro** – transferring centralized currency from the national to supranational level – seemed like insanity before it was implemented, but has since become a comfortable convenience both across the Eurozone and for its trading partners outside that economic block.

The question to be answered is whether a decentralized currency can be embraced on equivalent scales.

### The crypto economy

One of the concepts often discussed in the context of blockchain technology is the so-called global **crypto economy**. The spectrum in which this concept is discussed ranges from the fundamentalist free market advocates to large corporations trying to anticipate and capture emerging applications.

It is important to note that the term "crypto economy" is merely used to describe *new and sometimes different business models*. It is still just economics, the same rules apply and it can be assessed with traditional analytic models. The only difference is the scope and access of the underlying infrastructure.

The concept of the crypto economy could translate to two types of business models:

* **Internal business models:** a pure crypto economy is where all activity happens **within one blockchain network**. The blockchain network is not used to track or react to things happening outside of the network.
* **Mixed business models:** mixed approaches combine activity happening outside the blockchain network with activity or tracking within it.

The blockchain network and processes **within** can be seen as belonging to the **internal sphere**, whereas the realm **outside** of a blockchain can be seen as being part of the **external sphere**.

![Crypto economy](images/crypto-economy-no-glass-01.png)

Most new blockchain-associated business models can be counted to the mixed category. These are much more common and can be expected to continue being more popular than internal blockchain business models. Such business activities typically rely on external data and will have to maintain doing so. Furthermore, in many cases, it is probably more cost-efficient to employ mixed business models.

Existing parts of business operations could be substituted with blockchain-based solutions in cases where these are more efficient, while those parts that would not benefit much from a blockchain-based solution or are not well-suited for implementation on a blockchain could be kept in the external realm. Thus, mixed business models will probably be more implemented than internal business models.

## Cryptocurrency fundamentals

The term cryptocurrency is a combination of two concepts, **cryptography** and **currency**. It is worth defining both terms precisely and concisely before continuing.

**Cryptography** refers to techniques for securing private transfers of information in an environment in which the presence of adversarial interests cannot be discounted. Historically, this could mean spies passing messages to their governments, but it has evolved into a fundamental aspect of how almost any digital system communicates.

**Currency** means *money in circulation as a means of exchange*, and mainly fulfills three functions to be considered as such. It must be:

* **A store of value**
* **A method of transfer**
* **A unit of account**

As a **store of value**, a currency can maintain a value that can be then traded for other assets of value (**method of transfer**), and at the same time be measured and compared (**unit of account**).

Therefore, a **cryptocurrency** can be defined as *a digital asset, which functions as a medium of value exchange, bound to the cryptographic protocol of a decentralized network and its programmed rules*. As such they are always tied to a blockchain.

For more context regarding how cryptocurrencies have evolved, take an optional deep dive through the history of money itself below.

<ExpansionPanel title="A brief history of money">

To be able to better understand cryptocurrencies and the revolution they represent, it is sound to first take a look at money, what it is, and how it has developed over time as a concept, maintaining certain characteristics but also changing others.

**Money** can be defined as *a method to transfer value*. As such, it serves as a means to purchase or acquire services and goods.

When taking this general understanding as a starting point, one can see that many materials have been used as money for a long time. As early as 10,000 BC the trade of goods began. By around 2,000 BC, metals were used as a means representing value – the first forms of true "money". With time, gold and silver became more common as a means around the world, and with it, the concept of currency started crystallizing.

**Currency**

Gold was popular as a material for currencies for centuries. As a rare material that cannot be reproduced and does not perish, it is a very good **store of value** compared to materials like salt or cocoa that were also once used as currencies for trade. It has a high density and occupies little space, which makes it a good **method of transfer** since merchants could take it on their travels to purchase other goods of interest. Finally, it is *fungible*: a given quantity of gold has a consistent value because its characteristics are the same – not true of all high-value raw goods, like diamonds, whose quality is judged by other features than mass.

However, material-based currencies have their disadvantages. Mixing gold with less valuable metals to dilute its purity and deceive traders regarding its apparent value became a serious issue, its significant weight makes it difficult to transport in large quantities, and gold could also take an ornamental form - this might increase its value beyond that of the raw materials, but would pose an impediment to trading a smaller portion than the total unless a desperate trader was willing to melt his treasures or break them into pieces.

**A new era - paper or "fiat" money**

As a reaction, new systems were introduced. The one remaining nowadays is **paper money**, or fiat money. The first use of paper money was recorded in China during the Yuan and Ming dynasties.

Fiat money is a form of currency that does not itself hold an intrinsic value, i.e. it does not have a "use value" (such as how commodity money like gold can be made into jewelry). Instead, its value depends on a government or other authority ascribing and maintaining value to it - though it also derives value as soon as it is used as a means of exchange.

The original implementation of paper money would be as an IOU (for "I owe you"), a paper note issued by a bank in exchange for the deposit of a sum of material goods, like gold. The IOU indicates the bank's commitment to reimburse the deposited value, meaning that the note can be treated as a transfer of those goods by proxy. There are significant advantages: the value is maintained while being far more easily transportable and the resulting "units" of currency can be made convenient, such as by baring multiple IOUs for different sums.

However, trust becomes a critical factor in the fiat money system. A bank's IOU must be seen as reliable in a way that an ounce of gold is by default. Therefore, one can observe a shift from a **decentralized system** (when currencies used to be commodity-based) to a **strongly centralized system** (when currencies became fiat money and thus, the access and supply became regulated through a central authority).

**The modern monetary system**

After the onset of fiat money, currencies remained **pegged** (meaning *linked*) to sources of material wealth to assure the value they supposedly represented. This led to the storage of valuable materials and goods to back-up fiat currencies. The pegging of currency to gold was called the **"gold standard"**, which in the industrial era was the most consistent basis for global currency valuation before the 1970s, when the US Dollar became the value holding upon which other currencies relied upon. Since then, the era of "floating currencies" has been dominant, in which market trading is a significant factor in the comparative values of different regional or national currencies.

Fiat money fulfills all the functions required from a currency. It is light and easy to transport, easy to count and audit, and it is rare because production is regulated by authorities. Central authorities can indeed print as much money as they want, so they can influence inflation rates and with it control the money supply and its value. High inflation rates make currencies less suited as a store of value – the more money is printed, the lower its value.

Now, let us turn to our **monetary system**. Every monetary system must fulfill three functions:

* Provide access to money.
* Allow the possibility to send and receive money.
* Supply money according to the system's needs.

These functions have until recently been the main task area of centralized authorities, mainly central banks and entities dealing with monetary as well as fiscal policies. However, trust in a currency is strongly linked to the degree of trust in the central authorities. The global financial crises of the last several decades have ensured that this trust is far from stable.

**Digital money and the onset of cryptocurrencies**

The digitalization of money has many advantages, but can also be problematic. As computer systems emerged and continuously improved, digital ledger keeping and accounting were introduced. Most of our current monetary system is ruled by "digital money".

Storage costs and transport are much easier with digital money compared to paper money. In addition, splitting it is very simple, which makes it a good unit of account, and it is very fast to process transactions and also audits. The exchange of currencies can be undertaken completely on a technical level.

However, a general problem of digital products also applies to money: *multiplication*. Digital money is only as tamper-proof as the system that is used to keep track of it. For this reason, governments have opted to further centralize money, limiting the decision on eligibility for account opening, access, balances, and transferring to local and central banks.

Efforts to decentralize digital money again suffered from it not being a suitable store of value, even if a decentralized currency system would remain a good method of transfer and unit of account. How to regulate the governance of money supply, access, and transferring remained an issue in a decentralized system. This is where cryptocurrencies come in handy.

## The potential of cryptocurrencies

Since all currencies have to fulfill three functions – *to be a store of value, a unit of account, and a method of transfer* – it can legitimately be asked: **are cryptocurrencies a better currency compared to fiat money?**

Cryptocurrencies have been vastly publicly discussed and evaluated since Bitcoin's introduction, and policies to handle these new types of currencies have been different from country to country. The role cryptocurrencies will play in future economic activities and everyday life is difficult to envision, as the spectrum of opinions goes from cryptocurrency-integration supporters to complete-dismissal advocates.

Fiat money is a good unit of account. However, at least when compared to digital money, cryptocurrencies are even better as the ledger on which their transfers are recorded is immutable. They are also more fitting as a method of transfer: they can be transferred in almost real-time, while also having low transaction and storage costs.

However, while they function well as a store of value, cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile, which is less than optimal for a store of value – here fiat money might be a better fit.

At the same time, cryptocurrencies have not yet seen all their potential.

Not only are crypto transactions recorded on an **immutable ledger**, in public blockchains they also represent a potential **decentralized financial system** with open access. This more democratic possibility for financial transactions has been celebrated, especially by those disappointed by the events related to economic and financial crises and whose trust in traditional, centralized institutions has been shaken.

**Tokenization**, _the inclusion of asset rights onto a blockchain (stocks, gold, bonds, real estate, etc.)_, is argued to possibly become an opportunity to conduct traditional investment forms in a faster and more cost-efficient manner. It can also further help with decreasing the need for intermediaries and could increase the liquidity of assets due to an improved transfer.

Moreover, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and other forms of tokenization have been compared to *capital ventures and other forms of equity*. When drawing a comparison, one can argue that ICOs create alternative funding mechanisms, especially attractive for start-ups and entrepreneurial business ventures. These types of businesses usually have a high cost to raise capital. ICOs could also provide a real investment opportunity for those investors that do not possess sufficient funds to be considered in a traditional fund setting.

<HighlightBox type="info">

More information on ICOs will be provided in this section.

The potential of cryptocurrencies always has to be seen in a differentiated manner, keeping in mind possible negative implications and barriers that hinder cryptocurrency adoption.

A closer look at two particular areas will be illustrative of cryptocurrency's potential: altcoins and raising capital with ICOs.

### Altcoins as a business model

In the wake of Bitcoin's success, many other cryptocurrency networks were launched, collectively referred to as alternatives to Bitcoin. Because these so-called **altcoins** are easy to operate but hard to regulate, they have provided a hotbed for scams and frauds – such as "rug pulls", in which project insiders wait for investments to accrue before extracting all value and leaving investors out of pocket.

Some collapsed projects were genuinely well-meant failures of course, but despite the odds, many have survived, as a quick look at [Coinmarketcap's list](http://coinmarketcap.com/) proves.

Altcoins can be worth investigating for two key reasons:

* They provide an outlet for innovation in a technological field otherwise refused by stakeholders of other currencies.
* They produce interesting case studies to understand how the crypto economy and the rest of the world interact with each other, where the crypto economy can work, and where it is bound to fail.

Moreover, altcoins also follow **regular economic patterns**. For example, any newly launched cryptocurrency network must differentiate itself from other systems to be able to attract users and be profitable. Attracting users is essential to increase network effects – the value of goods or services increases alongside usage. Altcoins are *network goods* and thus, rely on increasing user numbers to be attractive to new potential users and to establish their market dominance.

<ExpansionPanel title="Litecoin and Scotcoin">

A prime example of an altcoin as a business model is the launch of **Litecoin** in 2011. An early forking of Bitcoin triggered the creation of a procession of new cryptocurrencies, as disagreements regarding technical choices or questions over developer ethics led to a splintering of projects of which Litecoin was one. Two years later it would see massive value growth and by 2022 had attained a market capitalization of $8.7 billion.

This demonstrates the potential for success strictly within the conventional confines of crypto. There have also been several attempts to tie cryptocurrencies to external business activities, but most of them have not been particularly successful. Why would that be?

It is very difficult to link things that are happening within a blockchain network to activities and events happening outside of it *without using trusted authorities*. When a trusted authority is included in the design, the selection and inclusion of such authorities as well as other aspects related to their role and function would have to be incorporated into the network design.

An example of this challenge is [**Scotcoin**](http://scotcoin.org/), a not-for-profit company with the goal of making itself ubiquitous across Scotland as a nationally delineated yet decentralized digital currency.

If the Scottish government was to adopt Scotcoin as the *official* digital currency of Scotland, their trusted authority would have to be able to influence the state of the blockchain network. Currently, traditional currencies are issued by central banks. These hold the monopoly right to issue currencies in their area of circulation, mostly the respective country. This allows central banks to regulate the production and issuance of currencies. The regulation of the monetary base is called monetary policy.

A central bank's monetary policy is strongly interrelated to national fiscal policy, which lies in the hands of governments. Scotcoin would require including the Scottish government and their respective central bank in the implementation of the cryptocurrency, while also possibly needing to integrate possibilities to implement monetary and fiscal policy.

### Raising capital - Initial (Public) Coin Offerings (ICO/IPCO)

In capital structure theory, one often differentiates between **internal and external financing**.

* **Internal financing** refers to situations in which a company uses profits as a source of capital by re-investing them instead of distributing profits among the owners or investors, or when **provisions are liquidated** to generate a financial resource.
* **External financing** describes a situation in which financing of new investments and firm activities are done through means like equity issues, such as IPOs and credit financing.

![Traditional financing possibilities](images/Traditionalraisingcapital.png)

Currently, the most interesting aspect of how blockchain technology impacts finance activities is in new forms of raising external capital.

Blockchain technology bears the potential of creating a means to raise capital detached from "traditional" ways of external financing. **Crowdfunding** is one of the proved use cases of blockchain technology. Combined with smart contract automation, the potential for implementation in regard to **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** campaigns is very high.

The **Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO)** has become a very popular method for crypto projects to raise capital, although there is no reason why traditional businesses should not be able to use the same mechanisms to raise funding.

ICOs usually involve investors buying either **tokens** or the promise of future tokens once a project is implemented. These tokens are usually tradeable after the project is launched, sometimes even before, and the revenues from these sales are used to finance projects. Investors buy these tokens in the hope that they gain value as they are being adopted in the future.

There are two common ways that tokens have been **issued** in the past for ICOs:

* Either token are promised **as part of the initial distribution of a cryptocurrency** in a blockchain network - this was the case with Ethereum, DECENT, BitShares, Factom, and many more.
* Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are used in projects to **issue tokens for future activities** - as in the case of Augur and SingularDTV.

Because of their similarity to stock offerings, many projects execute their ICOs as software pre-sales (e.g. Ethereum and DECENT). However, the legal dimension of ICOs is uncertain and the practice of token offerings has been debated and criticized. Additionally, other mechanisms to use tokenization as a means of financing have been explored in the blockchain space.

## Barriers to cryptocurrency adoption

There are several factors that can hinder the adoption of cryptocurrencies. First and foremost, the use of cryptocurrencies is strongly related to the degree they are entrusted as currencies. As mentioned, trust is derived from the rules and postulations of the underlying blockchain protocol. Cryptocurrencies cannot rely on the trust mechanisms observed in central authorities as they are the result of decentralized networks.

Moreover, trust can also be diminished by the insecurity perceived concerning cryptocurrencies. The accounts of ICO scams, a missing regulatory framework, the absence of central authorities, and the sheer amount of cryptocurrencies on the market make them difficult to assess. Thus, users could be discouraged from engaging with cryptocurrencies.

ICOs and tokenization are also often viewed as risky because legislation and regulation are still developing. A missing regulatory framework and standard setting increase insecurity for consumers as there is no framework of rules protecting consumers and demanding certain requirements from issuers.

Furthermore, the vast amount of currencies not only makes it difficult to maintain an overview but also to decide on the right cryptocurrency. Especially in an ICO setting, investors are speculating on positive returns. Risk-averse investors could be reluctant to invest in a cryptocurrency because of the high degree of uncertainty. In addition, the high volatility of cryptocurrencies can further discourage investments in such new forms of financing.

![Volatility](images/volatility.png)

Volatility is often used as an indicator for securities and market indexes, but also other assets with a value bound to market mechanisms. The volatility of cryptocurrency trading in market places is quite high.

Another result of high volatility is that cryptocurrencies are not well-suited as a method of payment. If the value of a currency changes quickly, do you really want to use it to pay for goods and services? If you make a purchase but find the next day that your currency has doubled in value overnight, the value of your purchase has effectively been halved. High volatility, therefore, undermines cryptocurrencies as a regular and wide payment means.

In conclusion, there are a number of barriers to cryptocurrency becoming accepted on a wider basis, but also great potential. The adoption of cryptocurrencies depends largely on consumers feeling comfortable using and trusting in them. In addition, adoption will also depend on how the cryptocurrency environment develops: Will a handful of currencies become dominant? Will volatility fall with decreasing speculation once the dust settles? Only time will tell.
