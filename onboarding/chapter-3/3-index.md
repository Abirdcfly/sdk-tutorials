<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Blockchain Advanced</h1>

In the first two chapters of this course, you took an introductory look at a wide variety of elements relating to blockchain, first with [an overview of the field](LINK TO CH1 HERE), and then by focusing in on [the basic mechanisms that underpin the technology](LINK TO CH2 HERE) and how they have evolved into the platform Cosmos provides.

Chapter 3 is designed to provide a deep dive into technicalities of blockchain, suitable for those who will be working directly alongside colleagues in technical roles (such as coders), but will also be of interest to anyone who would like to know in more detail about the functioning of blockchain systems.
