<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Introduction to Blockchain and Cosmos</h1>

Maybe you're already familiar with blockchain through personal or professional experience, or maybe you are coming into this exciting field knowing little more about the technology than what you've seen in news headlines, memes, and social media gossip. In either case, the world of blockchain is fast-moving, and its always good to keep up-to-date and have some knowledge of your field, regardless of your specific role in the organization.

This course aims to get you up to speed, at a level that is beneficial to your needs.

At the end of Chapter 1, you will have a conversational level of general knowledge regarding both blockchain and Cosmos. Chapter 2 will go on to explore the mechanics of blockchain in an accessible way, at which point you will basically understand how the technology works.

If you will be working alongside colleagues in technical roles – or if you're just eager to learn more! – then Chapters 3 and 4 will build on this foundation to provide a more detailed understanding of the key characteristics of blockchain in general and Cosmos in particular.
