# Working in the Blockchain Era

## Introduction

The realization of blockchain as a practical concept immediately began to influence thinking outside of the specific context of networking structures and information storage. As a result, some "disruptors" are employing new tools and philosophies when it comes to doing business which have their origins in blockchain technology.

## Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps)

So far this course has frequently used financial transactions as a convenient way to illustrate the functioning of blockchain – however, a "transaction" can really be *any* kind of data transmission, not necessarily some directly related to money.

The potential this represents was first implemented by **Ethereum**, a platform which was designed to allow the creation of decentralized applications (dApps): pieces of autonomous software that are stored on and run from a blockchain. dApps typically utilize smart contracts, which are also autonomous computer programs (or transaction protocols).

### What is a contract?

This question may seem too obvious to be worth answering, but spelling it out will be useful: 

* **A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that is intended to be enforceable by law**.

Contracts usually concern matters like employment, or the rent or sale of goods and services. All parties agree on the terms of the contract – they specify what each must do to satisfy their obligation, and perhaps list any penalties or steps that must be taken if someone fails to do as agreed, which may or may not include terminating the contract.

So far, so simple. However, there are implications to a contract which quickly can become complicated. How are the activities of each party monitored? Who adjudicates if the parties disagree about compliance? Who enforces any penalties? These last two questions in particular demand the involvement of third party authorities to rule on the situation, which goes against the general philosophy of decentralization and distribution that is at the heart of blockchain.

### What is a smart contract?

A **smart contract** is a similarly binding agreement in software form. The terms of the contract are codified in the software such as by using a series of ***If/When…Then*** statements which trigger or are triggered by certain inputs, like the actions of one of the parties.

Information is communicated to the smart contract, which checks it against the terms and reacts automatically, for example by releasing payment for services rendered. Provided the relationship is well understood and all conditions are agreed in advance, the automated nature of the smart contract's operations removes the need for any third party involvement.

<HighlightBox type="Example">

Imagine a business relationship between two companies:

* Company A produces goods
* Company B delivers goods to a client's customers
* **Service Agreement**: *Delivery of Goods for an agreed fee*

The smart contract might define key events of the supply chain:

**Trigger event**:
 * WHEN A produces 100x Units, THEN B collects and delivers

**Fees and Bonuses:
 * IF B delivers **on time**, THEN A pays B 100%
 * IF B delivers **early**, THEN A pays B 125%

**Penalties**:
 * IF B delivers **late**, THEN A pays B 75%
 * IF B **returns** the delivery, THEN B pays A 50%
 * IF B **loses** the delivery, THEN B pays A 150%

</HighlightBox>

<HighlightBox type=Note>

In this example, the operations of the smart contract only rely on data about each party's activities, but the inputs to a smart contract could be much more diverse, and could come from entirely different sources. 

For example, the calculation of the fee might depend on the cost of fuel: when Company A triggers a delivery, the smart contract requests up-to-date fuel price information from an agreed source and adjusts the fee accordingly.

</Highlightbox>

The nature of blockchain is ideal for smart contracts, because they provide an unchangeable, time-specific, retraceable record of all the information going into the smart contract and all activity triggered by it. Any party to the contract can audit their relationship at will, secure in the knowledge that tampering is either completely impossible or implausibly difficult and expensive to achieve – blockchain features which will be explored in greater detail in Chapter Two of this course.


## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) 

Smart contracts are attractive tools, because they enable applying the desirable features of blockchain to a wider variety of purposes than the cryptocurrency platforms that gave rise to them. The fact that these features are desirable at all therefore prompts a question: if decentralization can offer benefits to *the activities* of a business, why not directly integrate those benefits into a business itself?

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**, or DAOs, take the lessons of blockchain as they were applied to networks and apply them to organizational structures. They feature no central leadership or hierarchical management, with decisions made from the bottom-up by a democratic membership which owns and manages the entity collectively. The governance of DAOs is highly transparent, with its underlying software available for review by potential members, and the nature of blockchain ensures it cannot be changed in secret.

The rules which govern a DAO are established using smart contracts, which must be carefully planned and tested by the developers before launch. The DAO then raises funds, typically by selling tokens which grant the holders voting rights on a range of issues, such as which activity proposals will be adopted, when the DAO's treasury may be accessed, or whether to change some aspect of governance (i.e. by modifying the smart contracts). From this point on, the members control the organization collectively – the original developers have no more authority than any other stakeholder.

Various groups might find this "Internet-native" organizational structure a very useful arrangement. A freelancer collective could pool their funds to achieve some useful goal, like renting a shared work space, or buying specialist software which the members could not individually afford. A charitable group could nominate beneficiaries and vote to approve donations, while minimizing the drain of administration costs by removing traditional administration. However, for all its potential, when the idea of DAOs was put into practice on a major scale it was very nearly DOA instead.

<ExpansionPanel title="Dead On Arrival: the story of 'The DAO'">

**The DAO** was launched in 2016, designed using the Ethereum blockchain to be an decentralized autonomous venture capital fund. Token holders would share the profits of the organization's investments, either through dividends or by the increase in token value itself. The DAO raised the equivalent of $150 million in the cryptocurrency Ether, one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns in history.

Unfortunately, coding errors in The DAO's software left it vulnerable to attack. This was noticed shortly after launch, and therefore any change to the underlying smart contracts needed to first be proposed and then voted on by the stakeholders before it could be implemented. A proposal was adopted, but before any action to fix them was taken an attacker exploited them and siphoned out $60 million worth of The DAO's funds.

Although in the end these funds were reclaimed, doing so forced a "fork" of the Ethereum blockchain, dividing it into two different systems. It is also debatable whether the attacker actually did anything wrong: their actions were perhaps unethical, but they were effectively allowed by the nature of The DAO's smart contracts, "the law" for what was permissible.

This underlines a potential challenge of operating a DAO. While they can do away with some features of traditional organizations to beneficial effect, they may operate in a gray area of traditional law, and doing so implies risk.

</ExpansionPanel>

DAOs are very new approaches to technology, and there are potential legal question marks hanging over their use. Because a DAO is decentralized and participants may be distributed across the world, in the event of a legal challenge it may be difficult to determine what jurisdiction applies, or even whether multiple regional laws must come into effect.


## How Web3 is impacting employment and business culture

Whether a person is employed by a conventional company, is a freelancer or member of a DAO, or is simply an engaged participant in the modern internet, there are some general observations that can be made about working in the Web3 environment:

* There is lots of innovation – blockchain technology enables teams to build projects that have never been done before.
* There are an extremely broad range of use cases, from the purely financial to environmental activism projects.
* There are often strong ideological factors at play – projects are positioned as being "disruptive" to the status quo, and groups can be prone to division over contentious issues.
* Lots of projects fail – it’s easy for anyone to get involved, which can result in inexperienced teams working with a complex, still emerging technology.
* The environment is both fast-paced and potentially chaotic – legislation changes often, can be inconsistent or even non-existent in different regions, and there is a lot of market volatility.

Some additional factors are worth looking into in a little more detail.

### Importance of Community

Community is a big factor in Web3. In many cases, a community is often established before a product, with products arising out of community discourse.

Developers may begin the community-building process by sharing a roadmap, a promise of what the community can expect from the project. In the lead-up to launch developers can engage with the growing community, allowing them to influence what the project ultimately creates, for example by encouraging them to propose or vote on potential project features, with the developers committing to building a product co-defined by the community.

This kind of interaction often takes place on social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram, and Discord, with communities as distributed as any other feature of this ecosystem. However, this distribution is also true of development teams: with remote working ever more established as a business practice even among conventional organizations, it is natural that those in the Web3 space would be on the front line of adoption.

For globally distributed teams working asynchronously on a single project (with individuals potentially contributing to multiple projects simultaneously), it is essential to foster a strong team culture and have a clear framework for making decisions and taking action.

### Decision-making

Given the pervading influence of blockchain-derived ideas such as shared responsibility and process transparency, it should not be surprising that **decision-making processes in Web3 tend to embrace the democratic model**. Decisions are publicly discussed, voted on, and recorded collectively in fundamentally democratized and transparent decision-making.
Web3 means participatory governance, giving people the power to set rules by a majority.

This is best illustrated by DAOs: once the primary work of the development team is complete (which itself may be a highly open and community-collaborative process), control is entirely handed over to the DAO's membership. Although a project's developers will likely remain part of that membership moving forward, from the point of launch onward even performing essential maintenance on the underlying software will require the support of the majority.

More traditional business entities within Web3 may retain more centralized decision-making, but that still leaves opportunities for transparency and participant autonomy. The vertical hierarchy that typifies corporate management serves to minimize both the individual's independence and their insight into the organization's overall goals; by contrast, **flat organizational structures** are a popular Web3 alternative due to their increased agility; participants at all levels are brought closer together, making leadership decisions more visible, and participants are often granted the freedom to act and collaborate with each other in a more fluid or organic manner, with guidance and oversight less structurally imposed.
