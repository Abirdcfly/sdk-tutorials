# Blockchain, the Internet, and Cosmos

## Introduction

In the previous section, you looked at some basic core concepts about what blockchain *is* – a series of "blocks" of organized data, "chained" together in a fixed order – and what blockchain *does* – provides a system for shared record-keeping across a network with no centralized authority, relying on consensus between the participating nodes to reliably update the ledger. You also looked at the differences between centralized, decentralized, and distributed networks, and the advantages distributed networks can provide.

Now it's time to widen the perspective a little and examine the specific implications of using blockchain technology as part of the online world. 


## Why is Blockchain the future of the internet?

If you go back to the *beginning* of the internet – *before the internet even existed*, in fact – you can find the first conceptual seed of what it is now evolving into because of blockchain. 

The genesis of the world wide web is considered to be the document *Information Management: A Proposal*, written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, which introduced the idea of an information sharing system based on hypertext links. In it, he included the following observation, under the significant heading *"Non-Centralisation"*:

<HighlightBox type="info">

*"Information systems start small and grow. They also start isolated and then merge. **A new system must allow existing systems to be linked together without requiring any central control or coordination**."*

[Tim Berners-Lee, March 1989](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html)

</HighlightBox>

It is remarkable that the person whose ideas gave rise to the internet itself would highlight the value of non-centralization at the very beginning – and yet this is something which only decades later is finally being realized as a pathway for the future of the internet. 

This is why blockchain, *though Cosmos*, is the future. In essence:

* **Blockchain** allows us to create *networks* that do not require, as Berners-Lee said, "any central control or coordination".
* **Cosmos** is a system that links blockchains together *in the exact same way*.

Before looking at Cosmos in more detail, it is useful to consider how the internet has changed over time, and how it has differed from the concept Berners-Lee had in mind.


## Web1 > Web2 > Web3

One of the great challenges faced by historians is identifying when one period ends and a new one begins – often there is much debate about what criteria should be used to decide the boundaries between different eras, or even whether a particular era truly existed at all!

The terms *Web1*, *Web2*, and *Web3* can be thought of as the three supposed eras of the internet (although, as with history in general, there is disagreement about the dates assigned to them and their validity in general). They can be summarized as follows:

### Web1 (1991-2004)

At the beginning of the internet and for a long time after, most websites were static web pages, and very few internet users were producers of content. Most users were consumers, accessing information (and later downloading digital media, legally and illegally) that was created almost exclusively by large real-world entities, such as governments and corporations.

<!--WEB1 BANNER IMAGE (no idea… what does “the old internet” look like?)-->

The structure and philosophy of Web1 largely mapped onto that of the existing nature of off-line society: *centralized networks* in which users had little or no authority. However, note that the emergence of Wikipedia (2001), a collaborative information resource *maintained by user volunteers*, already heralded the changes to come.

### Web2 (2004 to the present)

In the second half of the lifetime of the internet to date, a significant shift occurred in which users increasingly *produced* content as well as consumed it. Facebook (2004), Youtube (2005), and Twitter (2006) were the frontline of the emergence of social networking as a cultural force and digital media as a domain for personal creative expression as well as corporate commercial product.

<!--WEB1 BANNER IMAGE 2-->

Web2 could be compared to a partially *decentralized system*. The network of Web1 systems still persists to this day, but now they coexist alongside platforms where users form networks independently, though within the constraints of those platforms.

### Web3 (the present to… the future?)

The onset of Web3 refers specifically to the appearance of cryptocurrencies and NFTs as an alternative to traditional centralized forms of value exchange. However, as with the previous two internet "eras" in which a shift in user agency is key to their definitions, using blockchain technology in more varied decentralized systems is where the ongoing potential of Web3 is seen to lie, such as *smart contracts* and *decentralized applications* (dApps).

<!--WEB1 BANNER IMAGE 3-->

Web3 implies the next step in the progression previously discussed, shifting the focus of the internet more to the *distributed* networking model. While the conceptual implementations of Web1 and Web2 will likely continue into the future, networks not reliant on centralized authorities are becoming an increasingly practical alternative.

### Questionable categorization, but unquestionable effect

As stated, not everyone supports these divisions, and any borders drawn between Web1, Web2, and Web3 must be considered indistinct. There have always been platforms online where individual users have expressed themselves as creators of content: first through text forums, then on blogs; then producing digital products like music or video, for pleasure or for profit, and leveraging the internet to sell tangible goods to customers around the world.

However, until now, almost all online systems have by necessity been centralized, since prior to blockchain that was the only available model of design. The opportunity for decentralized and distributed networks which Blockchain now makes possible is already disrupting this conceptual monopoly, and Cosmos seeks to expand this potential for systemic change.


## Strengths and Weaknesses of Blockchain

As discussed in the [previous section](LINK HERE), there are several key benefits which blockchain provides that could have a profound impact on the functioning of the internet:

* **Network and communication robustness**: distributed networks enjoy greater interconnectedness between nodes, reducing the number of weak-link points that can cause the network as a whole to fail.
* **Data security**: and duplication of the ledger across multiple nodes means that any loss, corruption, or subversion of data is harder to occur, or easier to correct.
* **Privacy and anonymity**: cryptographic techniques ensure user identities and the transaction details remain confidential even when the ledger is shared by all nodes.
* **User equality**: in the absence of a centralized network authority, any node can take a defining role in the progressive updating of the distributed ledger.

However, the nature of blockchain to date also presents some challenges to anyone seeking to use the technology in new ways, such as by developing blockchain-based applications, and the progression of "Web3" technology has been impeded by several factors. 

Blockchain is difficult to code, and at first developers were forced to base new projects on established systems, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This created other problems, like limitations of choice regarding coding languages and supportable features, or forcing all dApps to compete for processing time on a single master blockchain.

One critical issue was *siloing*, the inability for any two blockchain-based applications to interact with each other. Without resolving this issue, it would be hard to envision blockchain as a viable alternative to the current systems which dominate the internet.

Fortunately, **Cosmos** provides a solution.


## COSMOS

Cosmos offers developers a decentralized network for creating independent parallel blockchains. Developers are free to use a wider variety of programming languages, and instead of sharing space (and resources) on a single master blockchain, in Cosmos each dApp is created as a specialized blockchain within the shared environment. 

Crucially, unlike previous Web3 systems, the Cosmos ecosystem is designed to facilitate communication between different blockchains. It aims to create "an internet of blockchains", with all the freedom of specialization and communication that description implies.

### COSMOS IN 100 WORDS

The previous section began with a condensed summary of blockchain's key features. It would be useful to have similar definitions for Cosmos:

<HighlightBox type="info">

**Cosmos provides**:

* an **interoperable** ecosystem where different blockchain-based applications can interact through the *Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol* (IBC).
* a suite of modular development tools which greatly simplify creating blockchains, freeing developers to focus on their project's unique characteristics.
* a native cryptocurrency, *Atom*, which allows Cosmos users to participate in (and financially benefit from) a "democratic" consensus system through **staking**.
* fast updates with **transaction finality**, and significantly greater energy efficiency than previous blockchain applications like Bitcoin.
* the ability for applications *inside* the ecosystem to interact with those *outside* it (both traditional software and blockchain), bridging the past and future of the internet.

</HighlightBox>

You will have the chance to learn more about the specifics of Cosmos later in the course, but there are some key phrases here which are worth taking some time to explore directly.

### What is staking?

There are several different mechanisms which blockchains can use to form consensus about the creation of new blocks. The original method, popularized by Bitcoin and called *Proof of Work* (PoW), will be explained in a later section, but in essence it represents a competition between nodes to create new blocks, with the winner financially rewarded.

An alternative strategy is *Proof of Stake* (PoS). Here, a subset of nodes called "validators" commit (or **stake**) financial value using cryptocurrency to participate in block creation, and are rewarded for behavior that is beneficial to the network. 

Cosmos uses a variation called *Deligated Proof of Stake* (DPoS) which allows other nodes in the network to share in these rewards by **staking** their own crypto on the validators of their choice.

### What is transaction finality?

**Transaction finality** means that an entry on the shared ledger is absolutely finalized and can never be changed or removed. 

Blockchains which use PoW can never be *perfectly* certain of achieving transaction finality, although as time passes it becomes practically (if not theoretically) impossible for any change to be made to the transactions or blocks that appear earlier in the chain.

Blockchains which use PoS or DPoS, like Cosmos, benefit from instant transaction finality: when a block is added to the chain there is no possibility of its validity being challenged, and all the transactions within that block can be trusted as permanent and immutable. 

These concepts will be explained in more detail later in the course.

### What is interoperability?

**Interoperability** is the capacity for different computer systems to share information with each other and make use of what they receive.

We now tend to take interoperability for granted – people can connect to the internet from a range of devices, using different brands, browsers, and operating systems, and they typically have the same user experience if they navigate to the same website. However, some types of software still lack this universal convenience: standard office tools like word processors are notorious for ignoring the file types of rival products, or only opening them at the cost of formatting errors. This lack of interoperability creates barriers between freedom of interaction for users whose only "mistake" is that the tools they use are made by different companies.

This is the vital feature which Cosmos introduces to the blockchain context. By providing an **interoperable** environment, blockchain applications which would otherwise be unable to communicate or interact directly can do so by default. This greatly increases the power and complexity of what developers can achieve using this technology.
