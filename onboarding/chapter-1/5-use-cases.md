# Blockchain Use Cases

## Introduction

Now it's time to consider some practical applications of blockchain. Some people claim blockchain technology has the potential to change the world for the better – is there any evidence of this already?

This section will cover:

* Public networks
* Private or "Managed" networks
* Real World Use Cases


## Blockchain Categorization

There are various uses for blockchain that don't necessarily revolve directly around the transfer of monetary value. Some of these are already active in the world, others are yet to surface. Before you look at some specific cases, it is important to define two broad categories of system to which blockchain can apply: **Public** networks, and **Private** (or **Managed**) networks.

### Public Networks

Public networks are what blockchain technology was originally invented to service, and arguably they remain its most potent application. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are the most obvious examples. These are some key specific attributes that public blockchains generally share:

* **Accessibility**: participation is open to anyone with the necessary client software and an internet connection – and anonymity is acceptable, if not actually systemic.
* **Absence of hierarchy**: all nodes are equal, and all validators are equal.
* **Decentralization**: the previous features mean many public networks are completely decentralized; however, this may not work well with traditional business models.
* **Crypto-economic incentives**: without an absolute defense against malicious action, benevolence is reinforced via rewards which, in combination with often significant network scale, disincentivize behavior that might endanger network function.

### Managed Networks

Private or "managed" networks also rely on blockchain data structures. However, unlike public networks, for a managed network *Byzantine Fault Tolerance* (BFT) is not a critical factor to be solved. A public network encourages an emergent, anonymous hierarchy to temporarily arise within an unpredictable ecosystem; managed networks are predictable environments which maintain some traditional elements of authority and accountability, because these are very typical features of everyday companies and organizations.

Managed networks also differ from public ones in that they retain the necessity for some degree of trust, so their most logical use cases are where trust already exists between the participants. A hypothetical example might be a network between financial institutions used to settle inter-bank transactions, for which public access would be not just unnecessary but undesirable. Each institution could operate one validator, and no single node would be able to corrupt the network overall; however, if systemic revisions to the history were required, such work would represent a coordinated action by a small number of known, trusted actors.

Managed networks likely seek certainty that pending transactions will be included in the next block, and guarantees of network integrity, which the probabilistic nature of public blockchain networks cannot promise absolutely. Nevertheless, blockchain technology offers promising solutions to various concerns faced by a range of institutions; the challenge is in identifying how to take advantage of its strengths.

Managed networks may use blockchain as a way of perpetuating pre-existing relationships, or automating the administration of legally enforceable agreements. They can be:

* **Designed for limited numbers of vetted and approved participants**: performance challenges and poorly connected nodes are less important.
* **Designed for optimized performance**: participants in an enterprise network can typically run powerful, well-connected, high availability nodes.
* **Governed by well-defined agreements**: decision-making matters such as protocol upgrades, admission requirements, and remedial actions may be codified in advance.


## Real World Use Cases

The most obvious examples of blockchain in action are *cryptocurrencies* and *non-fungible tokens*, or NFTs, which in recent years have become a familiar part of the global discourse. Most people are already familiar with these applications, but click the following panels for a brief overview of each one.

<ExpansionPanel title="Cryptocurrency">

**Cryptocurrency**, casually referred to as "crypto", is a digital form of currency which isn't dependent on any central authority, such as a government or bank. Bitcoin was originally conceived to help explain the features of blockchain as a software tool, but went on to become the first actual cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable example to this day.

Alternative cryptocurrencies were originally based on copies or modifications of the Bitcoin code, a difficult undertaking, but **Cosmos** allows developers to create new blockchains for many purposes, including as cryptocurrencies, with far greater ease.

<ExpansionPanel title="Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)">

A **non-fungible token** is a tradeable digital asset (such as an image file), with the immutable nature of a blockchain record used to prove any transfer of ownership. Unlike the units of a cryptocurrency, NFTs are individually unique, which is the basis of their value. They are also relatively easy to create, even by people with little or no coding skills.

However, there is debate over the extent to which the sale of an NFT represents a legal transfer of rights or ownership over the associated digit asset. In practice, the trading of an NFT technically only represents a change in ownership of the NFT itself, not necessarily that of the asset, which typically is stored conventionally and referenced on the blockchain only by a URL. It is difficult to prevent anyone from accessing the target of the URL and creating a different NFT for the exact same asset, or even of duplicating the original file entirely.

</ExpansionPanel>

<HighlightBox type="tip">

The difference between cryptocurrencies and NFTs is that strange word, **fungible**. If something is fungible, it is fundamentally interchangeable with another example of itself. Two cans of a particular brand of dogfood are fungible, but two dogs are not, even if they are of the same breed – any pet owner will assure you that their dog is unique, and nobody ever swaps pets!

Similarly, bitcoins are much like any other unit of currency: if you exchange one $20 bill for two $10 bills, your wealth remains unchanged – because dollars and bitcoins are *fungible*. NFTs, as their full name suggests, are *non*-fungible: their worth lies in relation to some unique property (at least in theory), and ownership of an NFT is traded for actual financial value.

</HighlightBox>

However, there's a lot more to blockchain than just these high profile (and often divisive) examples. There are already more varied blockchain applications in operation today than can be easily summarized. The following use cases look at a few specific fields in detail to illustrate how blockchain technology can be leveraged in different contexts.

### Governmental Services

The first thing everyone associates with "government" is bureaucracy: endless red tape, challenges and failures of communication, the laborious duplication or unhelpful separation of data between (or even within) departments, and the expenses this costs taxpayers.

All of this can be countered through blockchain implementations. A unified, distributed public data resource could be made broadly accessible to a network of authorized governmental bodies while being secured against misuse or destruction, with any revisions to a citizen's records becoming immediately available for use across the system.

One fledgling example of this is [NDID](https://www.ndid.co.th/), or "National Digital ID", a public-private collaboration to provide citizens of Thailand with a unified online identification that facilitates the banking, credit, insurance, tax reporting, health care, and educational activities of millions of end users through a single, highly secure blockchain-based system.

### Healthcare Information

Blockchain applications can also deliver parallel but important-to-differentiate services relating to patient information. A person's medical history is, of course, potentially vital to their future, yet sharing information between institutions is notoriously difficult to manage. Simultaneously the raw data generated by patients as a whole can be invaluable, such as to ongoing scientific research, but protecting the privacy of individual patients is essential.

[HealthVerity](https://healthverity.com/) provides such services, with blockchain technology policing access permission to confidential data even as it is put to work for both the patient and interested third parties in approved, anonymized forms. [HashedHealth](https://hashedhealth.com/), which has spawned various blockchain-based platforms, is also developing a system to confirm the credentials of medical practitioners in America to prevent unlicensed activities in particular states.

There are also projects related to vaccine administration and tracking, and (while not directly medical-focused) numerous instances in the genomics industry, where the demands of personal data privacy are well-matched to blockchain's decentralized security.

### Vehicle manufacture and maintenance

The use of blockchain as a valuable tool for supply chains is now well-established, but it is worth underlining just how beneficial it can be, especially in contexts where human safety is a key concern, like vehicle manufacture, repair, and maintenance.

The ability to reliably track the provenance of components, and even identify the specific vehicles in which they are used, can impede the introduction of counterfeit parts, or allow for precision targeting of unit recalls if a component is found to be faulty. This significantly reduces costs to the manufacturer, and removes inconvenience to car owners who could be wrongly identified as needing maintenance because their particular vehicle does not contain an affected component. The [Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative](https://dlt.mobi/) aims to deliver whole-life vehicle records including complete maintenance histories and listing regional registrations.

Private ownership is not the only context, of course. In the airline industry, the tracking and tracing of parts is traditionally a largely manual administrative process open to costs, delays, and human error; blockchain has been estimated to potentially save billions through improved efficiencies, and the full digitization of maintenance records could lead to further benefits such as predictive maintenance, reducing aircraft downtime and accidents.

Aerospace and defense interests at both the corporate and state level are also implementing blockchain to streamline the tracking and retail of valuable components.

### Transportation and travel

Moving away from purely mechanical issues, other travel industries are implementing blockchain in numerous ways: decentralized ride-hailing services, in which independent drivers aren't beholden to a central business; tracking the use of public transport systems like buses and "bike shares" to improve services; securing and coordinating the range of personal data that airline travelers need to manage, like personal and passport data, payment details, immigration or border permissions, and now vaccination status. Smart contracts can also impact ticket purchases by delivering smoother booking processes.

The transportation of goods demands a great deal of information transfer, whether the supply chains in question are local, national, or global, so blockchain can obviously have useful applications here. The [Blockchain In Transport Alliance](https://www.bita.studio/) (BiTA) identifies this technology as a way to improve transactions, shipment tracking, fleet management, and efficiency in the trucking and freight industries.

Vehicle purchase or leasing can also be impacted, with blockchain offering iron-clad records of ownership or use, accident data, and insurance records. For example, the Estonian company [carVertical](https://www.carvertical.com/) uses a blockchain-based criteria search service for people interested in buying second-hand cars.

### Publishing and the Press

The concentration of power in publishing has been long criticized by observers, with the long-established "Big Five" forever absorbing smaller publishers and narrowing opportunities for less-established authors. Digital disruption of these so-called "gatekeepers" by Amazon and its rivals has led to accusations of market monopolization, and questionable practices towards publishers and individual authors alike. All this makes publishing a field ripe for innovative approaches to connecting readers with the written word.

Canadian platform [Bookchain](https://www.bookchain.ca/) applies blockchain technology to various aspects of digital publishing, offering authors new ways of distributing their work with indisputable proof of attribution, protections against illegal copying or transfers, and even allowing them to track the ongoing ownership of their ebooks should buyers sell them on legitimately.

Fact as well as fiction can benefit. As an immutable historical record, blockchain can have implications for news reporting, the context of how material is published, and how it is subsequently referenced. [The News Provenance Project](https://www.newsprovenanceproject.com/) and [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/), both in association with *The New York Times*, use blockchain features to fight misinformation or misuse by tracking how material is used and referred to, or identifying if it is manipulated.

Blockchain can also work against censorship, in that any content on a chain becomes almost impossible to modify or erase – provided the chain itself remains accessible, of course.


## Scratching the surface of blockchain possibilities

The previous examples were chosen to demonstrate the great variety of industries which blockchain could impact, but there are many more. It has already been applied to corporate governance and business forecasting; telecommunications and IoT, "the Internet of Things"; energy and waste management; commercial industries like construction, real estate, entertainment media, e-commerce, and retail; and resource management industries such as farming, fishing, logging, and mining – the list goes on.

Directly or indirectly, the work you do in your role contributes to this ever expanding culture of blockchain-based solutions to different activities around the world, both large and small.
