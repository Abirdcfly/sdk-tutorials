Chapter 3 delved into some core features of blockchains. In the final chapter of this course, you are provided with a similar deep dive with a specific focus on how Cosmos builds on the well-established nature of this technology to deliver "an internet of blockchains".

Again, this material is suitable for those who will be working directly alongside colleagues in technical roles (such as coders), but will also be of interest to anyone who would like to know in more detail about the functioning of Cosmos.

## In this module

* Engaging with the Cosmos ecosystem

At the end of the chapter you will find a **Resource Bank** which provides a concise run-down of xxxxxx. There is also a final self-assessment test so you can check your understanding of the chapter and of the course as a whole.
