<h1 class="mt-4 mb-6">Onboarding for non-technical hires</h1>

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">What you'll learn</h2>

The course content is designed to scale up your knowledge to a level that matches your needs. It starts by establishing some basic context, things that are good to know for anyone working in this field in a non-technical capacity. It goes on to explore both blockchain and Cosmos at a reasonably detailed level, suitable for someone in a non-technical role who may support or interact with colleagues who work directly with this technology.

During this course we are aiming to answer the following questions:

* Chapter 1 provides conversational general knowledge about blockchain and Cosmos.
* Chapter 2 explores the actual mechanics of blockchain in an intuitive and accessible way.
* Chapter 3 builds on this foundation to look at blockchain features in more concrete detail.
* Chapter 4 explains key features of Cosmos at a similar level.


<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">Timeline and deadlines</h2>

This is a **self-paced course** conducted across a four week period, with all course material accessible from the beginning. At the end of each week, a group support call will be held with a blockchain expert to answer any questions you may have. 

The course is structured in chapters of generally increasing complexity, which are each followed by an optional self-assessment quiz to test your understanding of the material covered.

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">How to get the most of the course</h2>

The Academy is self-paced and flexible, so you don't have to be online at particular times. All learning material is available from the beginning of the course, so you can follow the weekly plan or go through it at your own pace. The material is delivered in various formats, including text, images, videos, and quizzes. If you find something hard to grasp, be sure to raise it during the weekly support call.

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">How much time do I need to dedicate to the course?</h2>

The complete course represents between 12 and 20 hours of study time, including the self-assessment quizzes and any supporting material provided or linked to through the modules. Note that earlier chapters represent less intensive content than later ones, so if you intend to complete all four chapters you should plan your time accordingly.

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">What support will I get in the course?</h2>

Each chapter includes a useful **Resource Bank** which summarizes key chapter content for future reference. You will also have an opportunity to speak with a blockchain expert via the **weekly group video call** where you can raise questions about anything you've learned.
